# Source to Note Skill

## Purpose

Convert source material into atomic knowledge notes.

## Workflow

1. Read a source file from `source/` that has `status: new`.
2. Update metadata status to `digest`.
3. Extract and analyze content from the source file.
4. Determine knowledge density and decide note count.
5. Generate one or more knowledge notes following the atomic note rules.
6. Derive each note filename from its title by slugifying the title to lowercase kebab-case.
7. Assign categories and tags from the taxonomy indexes.
8. Generate a concise summary for each note.
9. Verify filename-title parity for every generated note — ensure the `slug` field matches the note filename (without `.md`).
10. Set metadata status to `publish`.

## Atomic Note Rules

A knowledge note should contain one reusable idea.

**Create a separate note when the source contains:**
- A distinct concept.
- A distinct process or workflow.
- A distinct decision or conclusion.
- A distinct rule, principle, or best practice.
- A distinct technical reference.
- A distinct troubleshooting pattern.
- A distinct comparison between ideas, tools, or methods.
- A distinct reusable question-and-answer pair.

**Do not create separate notes for:**
- Minor details.
- Repeated statements.
- Temporary observations.
- Personal commentary with no reusable value.
- Source summaries that do not introduce reusable knowledge.
- Content that only makes sense inside the original document.

Each note must be understandable without reading the full original source.

Each note should answer at least one of these questions:
1. What is this?
2. How does this work?
3. Why does this matter?
4. When should this be used?
5. What problem does this solve?
6. What should be remembered from this?

Prefer fewer high-quality reusable notes over many shallow notes. Do not force-split a single source into multiple notes. Only split when topics are truly too big and diverse to fit in one note.

Titles must be descriptive. Avoid single-word titles unless the word is a recognized proper name. Less than 18 words; aim for fewer, not more. The title alone should inform what the note is about.

## Filename Rules

- Generated notes must use lowercase kebab-case filenames.
- Notes must use `.md` extension.
- Note filenames must match note titles. Derive the filename by slugifying the title to lowercase kebab-case.

Example: A note titled "How Transformer Attention Works" becomes `how-transformer-attention-works.md`.

## Guiding Principle

Create knowledge details notes, not summaries.

## Template

All generated notes must follow `.system/templates/note.md`.

## Output

Knowledge notes in `notes/` and updated metadata sidecar files.
